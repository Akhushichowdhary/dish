# dish

1 cup rava / semolina

1 onion, finely chopped

¼ cup peas (fresh or frozen)

1 cup mixed vegetables, chopped (carrots, beans and capsicum)

2 green chillies, chopped (adjust to taste)

1 small piece ginger, grated

A few black peppercorns

A few curry leaves

1 tsp urad dal

1 tsp chana dal ( I like the crunch of the dals so use more!)

¼ tsp mustard seeds

A few roasted cashewnuts to garnish (optional)

Coriander leaves, chopped, for garnish

2 tsp Sesame oil

Salt to taste

Instructions

1. Dry roast the rava in a pan until it turns a light brown (about 7-10 mins). Transfer to a bowl when done and set aside to cool.

2. Heat oil in the same pan and add the mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal and curry leaves. When the dal turns golden brown and the mustard seeds splutter, add the onions, green chillies and ginger. Fry for 4-5 mins until the onions turn golden brown.

3. Now add the peas and vegetables. Mix well. Add about 3 cups of water and cook covered until the vegetables turn soft.

4. Open, add salt and mix well. Then lower fire to sim and add the roasted rava little at a time, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and stir for another 5 mins.

5. Remove and serve hot.

Goes well with vegetable sambar and coconut chutney!!
